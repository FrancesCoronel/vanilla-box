## Overview

### Requirements

This exercise is meant to demonstrate your ability to:

* Access a public API and successfully retrieve data from it;
* Display that data on a page;
* Update the UI of a page without refreshing;
* Build a polished user experience you'd be proud to ship; and
* Do all of the above using only native JavaScript (no libraries such as jQuery or React, although CSS and JavaScript preprocessors and polyfills are fine).
  * Please stick to JavaScript (e.g. not TypeScript or similar languages) for this exercise, and please ensure that all application code is your own.
* We'd like you to create a web page that shows a grid of photo thumbnails;
  * when a thumbnail is clicked, the photo should be displayed in a lightbox view, with the ability to move to the next / previous photos and display the photo title.
* You can use any public API that returns photos; here are some ideas:
  * [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photosets.getPhotos.html)
  * [Google Image Search](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview)

### Evaluation

Your changes will be graded based on adherence to

* product and design requirements,
* performance,
* browser support,
* code readability and organization,
* error handling,
* lack of defects,
* and documentation.

### Criteria

We‚Äôll get back to you within a week of your submission with the outcome. Please note that we will not provide you with detailed feedback on the exercise.

You have one week to complete your exercise, but please keep us posted if you end up needing more time.

Your submission must run without errors in the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge.

### Submission

When you‚Äôre finished, please send us:

* A URL where the working lightbox can be seen
* Your source code as a zipped Git repository
  * Create a local repo for your code and commit your files as you normally would; when the exercise is complete, zip your main directory, including the .git directory, and send it to us
  * **Note** If you use GitHub, please make your repo private or remove it after you submit your work. We wouldn't want someone to submit your work as their own later!
* Please provide all source code via a Git repository ‚Äì create a local repo for your code, and when the exercise is complete, please tar or zip your main directory and send it along to us (and please remember to include your .git directory/files).
* Please be sure to submit using the (GreenHouse) link provided in this email.
* If you have any notes or instructions about the exercise, please include them in a README.md file in your repo.
* We have implemented discretionary measures to ensure personal information is not associated with coding exercises. This enables the grader to make unbiased decisions, so we ask that you do not include your name anywhere in the code or documentation.
